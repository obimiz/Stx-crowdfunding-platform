## Crowdfunding Platform Smart Contract - README
This README provides an overview of the Crowdfunding Platform Smart Contract implemented in Clarity for the Stacks blockchain. The contract is designed to facilitate decentralized crowdfunding campaigns, enabling campaign creation, contributions, milestone-based fund release, and automatic refunds if campaign goals are not met. Here, we describe the key contract features, functions, and considerations for developers and users.

## Features
### Core Functionalities
- Campaign Creation: Users can create a campaign with details such as title, description, funding goal, deadline, and milestone specifications.
- Contribution System: Users can contribute to active campaigns, and contributions are recorded on-chain.
- Milestone-Based Payouts: Campaign creators can set up to 5 milestones with specific goals and amounts, allowing for controlled fund release upon milestone completion.
- Fund Claim and Refund Mechanisms:
Creators can claim raised funds if campaign goals are met by the deadline.
Contributors can claim refunds if the campaign fails to meet its funding goal by the deadline.

### Admin Controls
- Platform Fee Management: An admin can adjust the platform fee percentage.
Campaign Cancellation: Admins or creators can cancel a campaign, changing its status and enabling refunds.
- Milestone Approval: Admins can approve milestones, allowing funds to be released once specific goals are achieved.

### Key Contract Details
- Platform Fee: The contract deducts a 2% fee (default value, modifiable by admin) from successfully funded campaigns.
- Decentralized Campaign Ownership: Each campaign is associated with a creator and contributions are tracked by campaign ID and contributor principal.
- Campaign Status Tracking: Each campaign has a status of active, successful, failed, or cancelled, based on the campaign’s funding and milestone progression.

### Contract Structure
**Data Variables**
- Admin: The contract admin, defaulted to the deployer of the contract, with permission to update platform parameters and perform certain administrative functions.
- Platform Fee: Set to 2% initially, adjustable by the admin for platform fee deductions on successfully funded campaigns.
- campaign Count: Tracks the total number of campaigns created for unique campaign ID generation.

### Data Maps
- Campaigns: Stores campaign details (creator, goal, status, milestones, etc.).
- CampaignContributions: Tracks contributions per campaign and contributor, allowing contributors to monitor their invested amount and refund status.

### Constants
- Error Codes: Custom error constants (e.g., ERR_CAMPAIGN_NOT_FOUND, ERR_GOAL_NOT_REACHED) used for handling errors in contract execution.

### Functions
- Read-Only Functions
- get-campaign: Retrieves the details of a specified campaign.
- get-contribution: Retrieves a contributor’s details for a specified campaign.
- campaign-exists: Checks if a campaign with a given ID exists.
- calculate-platform-fee: Calculates the platform fee for a specified amount.

### Public Functions
Campaign Management
- create-campaign: Initializes a new campaign with specified parameters, such as title, description, funding goal, deadline, and milestones.
- cancel-campaign: Allows the admin or campaign creator to cancel an active campaign, changing its status to cancelled.

Contributions
- contribute: Allows users to contribute to an active campaign by transferring STX. Contributions are recorded, and the campaign’s total raised amount is updated.

### Fund Management
- claim-funds: Enables the campaign creator to claim raised funds if the campaign meets its goal by the deadline. The platform fee is deducted and transferred to the admin.
- release-milestone: Allows the admin to release funds for approved milestones, transferring the milestone amount to the campaign creator’s wallet.
- approve-milestone: Enables the admin to approve a campaign milestone, making it eligible for fund release upon completion.

### Admin Functions
- update-platform-fee: Allows the admin to update the platform fee percentage.
change-admin: Lets the admin transfer admin privileges to another principal.

### Helper Functions
- update-milestone-at-index: Updates a milestone’s release status based on the specified index.
- update-milestone-for-approval: Approves a milestone at a given index.
- update-milestone-status: Combined helper function for approving and releasing a milestone.

### Error Handling
The contract uses defined error codes to handle invalid operations, such as unauthorized access or insufficient funds. Notable error codes include:

- ERR_NOT_AUTHORIZED: Used for access violations.
- ERR_CAMPAIGN_NOT_FOUND: Indicates a missing campaign for invalid campaign IDs.
- ERR_GOAL_NOT_REACHED: Indicates that the campaign goal was not reached by the deadline, preventing funds from being claimed by the creator.

**Example Workflow**
- Creating a Campaign: The creator calls create-campaign, setting title, description, goal, deadline, and milestones. A unique campaign ID is generated and stored.
- Contributing: Contributors call contribute with the campaign ID and their STX contribution. The contract records the contribution and updates the raised amount.
- Milestone Approval and Release: Upon milestone completion, the admin approves the milestone using approve-milestone and releases the funds via release-milestone.
- Claiming Funds: If the campaign goal is met by the deadline, the creator can claim the funds after the platform fee is deducted.
- Refunds: If the campaign fails to meet its goal by the deadline or is cancelled, contributors can request refunds (this would need additional functions to implement fully).


**Conclusion**
This Crowdfunding Platform Smart Contract is designed to be a secure and transparent crowdfunding solution on the Stacks blockchain, emphasizing milestone-based fund management and user protection through structured error handling and admin oversight.
